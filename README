This distribution provides a set of modules:

Array::IntSpan - a Module for handling arrays using integer ranges
Array::IntSpan::Fields -  IntSpan array using integer fields as indices
Array::IntSpan::IP - a Module for arrays using IP addresses as indices


Array::IntSpan brings the speed advantages of Set::IntSpan (written by
Steven McDougall) to arrays.  Uses include manipulating grades,
routing tables, or any other situation where you have mutually
exclusive ranges of integers that map to given values (or objects) The
new version of Array::IntSpan is able to consolidate ranges by
comparing adjacent values.

Array::IntSpan::Fields brings the advantages of Array::IntSpan to
indices made of integer fields like an IP address and an ANSI SS7
point code.

Array::IntSpan::IP brings the advantages of Array::IntSpan to IP
address indices.  Anywhere you use an index in Array::IntSpan, you can
use an IP address in one of three forms in Array::IntSpan::IP.

Version 2.001 was heavily modified from version 1.01. The module was
heavily tested but you should test your application with v2.001 before
any important use.
